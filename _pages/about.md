Jingkun Chen is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford specializing in artificial intelligence, computer vision, large vision-language models, and multimodal risk prediction, with a focus on multimodal digital cardiac analysis. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Warwick (2020–2023) and his Master’s from the University of Dundee (2018–2019). His research was supervised by Kurt Debattista, Jungong Han (韩军功), and Jianguo Zhang (张建国). Jingkun has amassed rich research and industry experience with positions at SUSTech, Xinwang Times (Co-founder and CTO), and Qihoo, and has published high-impact papers in top-tier journals and conferences including TIP, TMI, PR, MedIA, and MICCAI.
